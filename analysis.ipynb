    "## Potential Sandwich Attack Pattern Matching Process\n",
    "The most common definition of a sandwich attack is when the above pattern matches for 3 consecutive txs. But because our analysis showed the occurance of this was so infrequent, we expanded our definition of a potential sandwich attack to explore deeper. In total, we analyze the following different scopes:\n",
    "1. 3 consecutive txs that match the above sandwich pattern\n",
    "2. 3 txs that match the above sandwich pattern, within the same block\n",
    "3. 3 txs that match the above sandwich pattern, within a 2-block interval (essentially combining 2 blocks and assuming they were a single block)\n",
    "\n",
    "# CONCLUSIONS: \n",
    "Our analysis shows that there have been no sandwich attacks on Osmosis during May 2022.\n",
    "- There was only 1 instance of 3 tx consecutive swaps that match a sandwich pattern in May 2022, and when you look into it it's not a sandwich attack, just trading activity.\n",
    "- If you expand to allow matching throughout an entire block, only 22 instances of txs matching a sandwich pattern, and when you look into it they are not sandwich attacks, just trading activity.\n",
    "- If you expand to allow two-block intervals, only 178 instances of txs matching a sandwich pattern, and when you look into it they are not sandwich attacks, just trading activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by \"just trading activity\"?\n",
    "Two or more of the following:\n",
    "1. \"Sandwicher\" using more pools than the \"sandwichee\" on their swaps\n",
    "2. Having an account that consistently trades back and forth same pools regardless of other traders (market making, vol strat)\n",
    "3. Having different input/output amounts for the legs of the sandwich (would expect clean sandwiches that just increase their balances, not change underlying portfolio distribution)\n",
    "4. Left slippage on the table (shows the first and last swaps have different purposes)\n",
    "5. The first and last tx in the sandwich being net unprofitable\n",
